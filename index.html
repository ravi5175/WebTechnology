            <P>Debugging is the process of detecting and removing existing and potential errors (also called ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.
            </P>
            <P>A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test and debug other programs (the "target" program). The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its operations
                in progress and monitor changes in computer resources (most often memory areas used by the target program or the computer's operating system) that may indicate malfunctioning code. Typical debugging facilities include the ability to run
                or halt the target program at specific points, display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of
                faulty program execution.

                Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android where it is the default browser built into the OS.The browser is also the main
                component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.

                Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help us edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps us build better web applications, faster.
